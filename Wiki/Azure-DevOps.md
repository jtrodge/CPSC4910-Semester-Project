# Summary
Azure DevOps is a project management tool used to do many tasks, such as:
- Define requirements
- Estimate effort points of requirements
- Assign tasks
- Push features into the current development period
- Query tasks and stories
- etc.

It also has the added bonus of coming with a .git repository if you so choose. 
Talking with the TA, this should work perfectly fine as long as we manage our versions effectively and keep a backup.

We'll probably just use 
1. the Sprint feature to generate stories and tasks for each milestone
2. the repository to keep track of Pull Requests (PRs), changes, etc.
