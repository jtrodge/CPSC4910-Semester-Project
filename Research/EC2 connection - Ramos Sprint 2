Welcome to your ec2 ssh crash course 
This is written assuming you have created an instance and recorded the .pem instance
    -  if not, re do class actibity

Step 1: Go to your created running instance, using the class work instance here from last week 
2: I cannot uplaod screenshot but write down the public ipv4 address
    - sidenote: must have port 22 running as I have noted from testing
3: From your terminal, go to the file location of your downloaded .pem file 
    - mine was in desktop, so '$cd ~/Desktop' for example
4: Make sure key is in read only by running the following:
    $chmod 0400 <filename>.pem
    *chmod 400 works too 
5: You should then be able to connect
    ssh -i <filename>.pem ec2-user@<public-ip from above>
    for me, it looked like: ssh -i test.pem ec2-user@172.31.61.26
6: if prompted, type yes to bypass conneciton question 

You are then ssh'd into the EC2
