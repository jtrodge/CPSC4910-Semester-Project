//A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts
//with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from
//the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire
//new pages.

//This is one of the methods of making the front end and the back end work together
//for python users

//Could use react as a use for our front end connection
