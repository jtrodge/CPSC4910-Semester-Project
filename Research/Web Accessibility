//Web accessibility is essentially ways or methods of making web content more accessible
//to people with a wide array of disabilities. Accessibility can be broken down into
//4 principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, robust. 

//Perceivable refers to the user ability to perceive it using one or more of their senses

//Operable refers to the user ability to control the UI elements of the content

//Understandable refers to the content being able to be understood to the wide array of
//people who might access or wish to access the content

//Robust refers to the content having and using well-adopted web standards that works 
//across many different browsers

//One way of making text more perceivable is to have alternatives for them such as 
//text-to-speech readers for the ui or if the web content displays information it could 
//be summed up through a short video link hosted on the website.

//Making sure that your website is operable is crucial to having well accessible content.
//Things such as making sure that the user can be granted full keyboard control, and/or 
//can use the keyboard in ways that allows efficient access and navigation to the site.
//Make sure that the user is given enough time to understand and use the content. And Make
//sure that there is nothing on the website that could possibly invoke seizures or cause 
//any sort of physical website.
