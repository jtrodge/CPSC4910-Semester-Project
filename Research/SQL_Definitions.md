Normalization: The process of refining a database to ensure that each independent piece of information is in only one place. (excluding foreign keys)

SQL: A nonprocedural language for manipulating data in relational tables. (you cannot write complete applications solely using SQL, unless you intend only to manipulate data)

SQL Schema Statements: Used to define data structures stored in the database.

SQL Data Statements: Used to manipulate data structures previously defined in the schema statements.
