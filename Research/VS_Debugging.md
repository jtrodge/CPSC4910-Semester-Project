Virtual Studio has a Python extension available with built-in debugging for python files.

Debugging Steps:
1. Select the location your code is in.
2. Select the debugging button on the left hand menu.
3. Below "Run and Debug" button click "create a launch.json file".
4. When prompted for the type select Python.
(customize the json file anyway you see fit; customize possiblities found online)
5. Open the file you want to debug.
6. Click any lines of codes to the left of the line number that you want to scrutinize to set a "breakpoint".
(the debugger will pause at break points and prompt you to make a decision)
7. With the "Run and Debug" tab open press the green arrow.
8. At each break point you have the option to "Continue", "Step Over", "Step Into", "Step Out", "Restart", or "Stop".
Continue: The debugger will continue past the breakpoint and run the program until reaching the next breakpoint.
Step Over: The debugger will go to the NEXT line of code.
Step Into: The debugger will enter into the following function.
Step Out: The debugger will exit the current function and continue running the program.
Restart: The debugger will start over again.
Stop: The debugger will stop and the debugging process will end.
