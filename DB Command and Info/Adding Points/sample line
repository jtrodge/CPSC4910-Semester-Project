Here is how to increment an integer, as oppsed to changing the numerical value (i.e. 3+3 instead of 3 = 6)

DECLARE @addvalue INT;  
SET @addvalue = 15;  
SELECT '125127' + @addvalue;

Swap + with - to subtract

this makes it much easier to link a prompt to a small script that increments or decrements the points by a designated value. 
Add edge cases and restrict adding decimals/negatives and the point system should be set, with debugging of course
